Key Components
Client

Editor: The core text editing component with real-time collaboration
MarkdownPreview: Renders the Markdown as HTML in real-time
UserPresence: Shows cursors and selections of other users
Sidebar: Document navigation and management
Visualizations: Charts and graphs showing collaboration metrics

Server

WebSocket Handler: Manages real-time connections and message routing
CRDT Operations: Handles merging of concurrent edits
Document Controller: API endpoints for document management

API Endpoints
EndpointMethodDescription/api/documentsGETGet all documents/api/documentsPOSTCreate a new document/api/documents/:idGETGet a specific document/api/documents/:idPATCHUpdate a document/api/documents/:idDELETEDelete a document
WebSocket Protocol
The application uses WebSockets for real-time collaboration. The WebSocket server is accessible at ws://localhost:5000/:docId where :docId is the document identifier.
Messages exchanged over the WebSocket connection follow the Yjs protocol.
